<p><strong>Early life: </strong>
Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra.[1] His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam.[2] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.[3] He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[4]

Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma’s old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".[4] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.[5]</p>

  <tr>
    <td> <p><strong>Youth and domestic first-class career: </strong>
Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in March 2005. Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3 wickets with 24 balls remaining. Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja made their debuts in the same match.[6] It was Sharma's unbeaten innings of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College Ground in Udaipur in the same tournament that brought him into the limelight.[7] He visited Abu Dhabi and Australia with the India A squad and was then included among India's 30-member probables list for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament, although he did not make the final squad.[8]

<p><strong>International career:</strong>
As of 28 March 2021, Sharma had played in 376 international matches (38 Test, 227 ODI, 111 T20I) and scored 40 centuries (7 Test, 29 ODI, 4 T20I).
<br><strong>Test matches:</strong>
In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in Kolkata against the West Indies and scored 177, the second-highest score on debut by an Indian to Shikhar Dhawan (187).[15] He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his home ground, the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.[16]

Having been out of the Test team since 2017–18, Sharma went on the 2018–19 tour of Australia after he had earned a recall earlier. Chief selector M. S. K. Prasad said the reason for his recall was that his natural game suited the bouncy Australian pitches.[17] Sharma played in the first Test in Adelaide, scoring 37 and 1 in an Indian victory.[18][19] During the first Test, he sustained a minor injury which saw him miss the second Test in Perth.[20] He recovered for the Boxing Day third Test at Melbourne and scored 63 (not out) to help India total 443/7 and win both the Test and the series.[21] After the third Test, Sharma had to return to India for the birth of his daughter.[22]

In October 2019, in the third Test against South Africa, Sharma scored his 2,000th run and his first double century in Tests. He made 212 in the first innings of the match.[23][24] Sharma was named as vice-captain of India's Test team during the tour of Australia in 2020, replacing Cheteshwar Pujara.[25][26][27]

Sharma had a successful home series against England in 2021. Instrumental in his team's comeback after a defeat in the first Test at Chennai, he scored a century, one that The Guardian termed "deserves to be considered one of the greatest this century."[28] He put on 167 runs with Ajinkya Rahane for the fourth wicket while making 161 runs in an innings that included 18 fours and two sixes.[29] India went on to win the Test by 317 runs.[30] He top-scored for his side in both innings of the low-scoring third Test in Ahmedabad with scores 66 and 25 resulting in his team's win.[31] He finished the series aggregating 345 runs, the most for India, at 58.[28]

    <br><p><strong>2015 and 2019 Cricket World Cups:</strong>In March 2015, Sharma made his first appearance in the Cricket World Cup and played in eight matches for India in the 2015 tournament in Australia. India reached the semi-final stage where they were defeated by Australia. Sharma scored 330 runs in the tournament with one century, a score of 137 in the quarter-final against Bangladesh.[32]

On 15 April 2019, Sharma was appointed vice-captain of India's squad for the 2019 tournament in England.[33] In the opening match against South Africa, he scored 122, including his 12,000th run in international cricket.[34][35] In the match against Sri Lanka, he became the first batsman to score five centuries in the same World Cup tournament,[36] and equalled Tendulkar's record for the most centuries in all World Cup matches.[37] Sharma totalled 648 runs in the tournament to finish as the leading run-scorer and win the ICC's Golden Bat award, the third Indian player to do so.[38]

<p><strong>Twenty20 international matches:</strong>Sharma was included in the Indian squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and made his mark by scoring an unbeaten 50 from 40 deliveries against hosts South Africa in the quarter-finals. This enabled India to win the match by 37 runs and they went on to defeat Pakistan in the final, when Sharma scored 30 (not out) from 16 deliveries.[59][60]

On 2 October 2015, during the South African tour of India, Sharma scored 106 in the first Twenty20 international at HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala. With that, he became the second Indian cricketer to have scored centuries in all three formats of international cricket.[61] On 8 July 2018, during a series in England, Sharma became the second Indian batsman, after Virat Kohli, to score 2,000 runs in a Twenty20 international career.[62] He was the fifth batsman worldwide to achieve the feat; the others besides Kohli were Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill and Shoaib Malik.[63]

In November 2019, in the opening match of the series against Bangladesh, Sharma became the most-capped cricketer for India in T20Is, playing in his 99th match.[64] In the next match of the series, he became the first male cricketer for India to play in 100 T20Is.[65]

In November 2020, Sharma was nominated for the ICC Men's ODI and T20I Cricketer of the Decade awards.[66][67]</p>
 <p> <strong>Indian Premier League:</strong>
Sharma has been one of the most successful players in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as captain since 2013 of the Mumbai Indians, who have won the tournament five times under his leadership.[68][69] He is currently (March 2021) one of four players who have scored 5,000 career runs in the competition. Sharma has 5,230 runs with one century and 39 half centuries and is the fourth-highest run scorer after Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina and David Warner.[70]

Sharma joined the IPL in 2008 when he was signed by the Deccan Chargers franchise, based in Hyderabad, for the sum of US$750,000 a year.[71] In the 2011 auction, he was sold for US$2 million to the Mumbai Indians.[72] He scored his only IPL century in the 2012 tournament with 109 (not out) against the Kolkata Knight Riders.[73] Under his leadership, Mumbai has won the IPL in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020; they also won the former Champions League Twenty20 competition in 2013.[6 </p>
